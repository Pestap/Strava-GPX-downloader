# Strava-GPX-downloader

The project aim has changed - the script will also conduct the analysis.

I am developing the project in order to analyze my own activites to determine what surafaces I ride on the most while cycling.


## Used technologies

The script was created using Python programming language. 

It uses Strava's API to get information about the user and her/his activities.

Overpass API will be used to get the information from Open Street Map such as surface of the road the user was riding on.
